# Sparselizard contributions
Open area for user contributions. We thank you for your help.

This is the place to provide your sparselizard example code or any other contribution of interest to the community.

Examples will only be added if you have validated them numerically (visual inspection of the solution is not enough).
Please provide a description in the main.cpp of the example, as many comments as you feel is needed and pictures to
give a visual idea of what the simulation is about. Providing the link to a paper used for validation as well as 
details on the math is always welcome (e.g. deriving the strong form equation from a known set of equations).
Do not forget to credit all contributors including yourself.

The contributions are provided 'as is' without any legal guarantee. The examples might have been cross-checked by
the community but there is NO GUARANTEE that anyone else than the author has checked it.
Please check the license with each contributor.
