A microstrip is defined a as track over a reference plane. In between, there is a dielectric with a relative permittivity that is usually not 1.
The impedance of any lossless transmission line Z_0 depends on L and C, respectively the unit inductance and capacitance per unit length.

The capacitance is easily found using sparselizard by placing a known charge on the track, and computing the voltage:

The inductance is linked to the speed of electromagnetic waves for that transmission line

( with c being the speed of light in vacuum )

In order to find the effective permittivity, we need to run the simulation with and without dielectric, as it is defined as the change of voltage.

A scilab validation code is provided and is based on Wheeler's model. That model is not exact: the error in impedance is usually less than 1%, but always less than 2%.
